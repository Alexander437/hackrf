    Spectral helper:
    Calculate various forms of windowed FFTs for PSD, CSD, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array or sequence containing the data to be analyzed.
    y : array_like
        Array or sequence containing the data to be analyzed. If this is
        the same object in memory as `x` (i.e. ``_spectral_helper(x,
        x, ...)``), the extra computations are spared.
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the cross spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxy` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the cross
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxy` has units of V**2, if `x`
        and `y` are measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz.
        Defaults to 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the FFTs are computed; the default is over the
        last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    mode: str {'psd', 'stft'}, optional
        Defines what kind of return values are expected. Defaults to
        'psd'.
    boundary : str or None, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is extended at both ends, and
        how to generate the new values, in order to center the first
        windowed segment on the first input point. This has the benefit
        of enabling reconstruction of the first input point when the
        employed window function starts at zero. Valid options are
        ``['even', 'odd', 'constant', 'zeros', None]``. Defaults to
        `None`.
    padded : bool, optional
        Specifies whether the input signal is zero-padded at the end to
        make the signal fit exactly into an integer number of window
        segments, so that all of the signal is included in the output.
        Defaults to `False`. Padding occurs after boundary extension, if
        `boundary` is not `None`, and `padded` is `True`.

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    t : ndarray
        Array of times corresponding to each data segment
    result : ndarray
        Array of output data, contents dependent on *mode* kwarg.
